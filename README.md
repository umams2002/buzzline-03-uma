# buzzline-03-case

Streaming data does not have to be simple text.
Many of us are familiar with streaming video content and audio (e.g. music) files. 

Streaming data can be structured (e.g. csv files) or
semi-structured (e.g. json data). 

We'll work with two different types of data, and so we'll use two different Kafka topic names. 
See [.env](.env). 


## Task 1. Use Tools from Module 1 and 2

Before starting, ensure you have completed the setup tasks in <https://github.com/denisecase/buzzline-01-case> and <https://github.com/denisecase/buzzline-02-case> first. 
Python 3.11 is required. 

## Task 2. Copy This Example Project and Rename

Once the tools are installed, copy/fork this project into your GitHub account
and create your own version of this project to run and experiment with.
Name it `buzzline-03-yourname` where yourname is something unique to you.
Follow the instructions in [FORK-THIS-REPO.md](https://github.com/denisecase/buzzline-01-case/blob/main/docs/FORK-THIS-REPO.md).
    

## Task 3. Manage Local Project Virtual Environment

Follow the instructions in [MANAGE-VENV.md](https://github.com/denisecase/buzzline-01-case/blob/main/docs/MANAGE-VENV.md) to:
1. Create your .venv
2. Activate .venv
3. Install the required dependencies using requirements.txt.

## Task 4. Start Zookeeper and Kafka (2 Terminals)

If Zookeeper and Kafka are not already running, you'll need to restart them.
See instructions at [SETUP-KAFKA.md] to:

1. Start Zookeeper Service ([link](https://github.com/denisecase/buzzline-02-case/blob/main/docs/SETUP-KAFKA.md#step-7-start-zookeeper-service-terminal-1))
2. Start Kafka ([link](https://github.com/denisecase/buzzline-02-case/blob/main/docs/SETUP-KAFKA.md#step-8-start-kafka-terminal-2))

## Task 5. Start a JSON Producer

In VS Code, open a terminal.
Use the commands below to activate .venv, and start the producer. 

Windows:

```shell
.venv\Scripts\activate
py -m producers.json_producer_case
```

Mac/Linux:
```zsh
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m producers.json_producer_case
```

What did we name the topic used with JSON data? 
Hint: See the producer code and [.env](.env).

## Task 6. Start a JSON Consumer

Consumers process streaming data in real time.

In VS Code, open a NEW terminal in your root project folder. 
Use the commands below to activate .venv, and start the consumer. 

Windows:
```shell
.venv\Scripts\activate
py -m consumers.json_consumer_case
```

Mac/Linux:
```zsh
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m consumers.json_consumer_case
```

What did we name the topic used with JSON data? 
Hint: See the consumer code and [.env](.env).

## Task7. Start a Custom JSON Producer

In VS Code, open a terminal.
Use the commands below to activate .venv, and start the producer. 

Windows:

```shell
.venv\Scripts\activate
py -m producers.json_producer_uma
```

Mac/Linux:
```zsh
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m producers.json_producer_uma
```

What did we name the topic used with JSON data? 
Hint: See the producer code and [.env](.env).

## Task 8. Start a  Custom JSON Consumer

Consumers process streaming data in real time.

In VS Code, open a NEW terminal in your root project folder. 
Use the commands below to activate .venv, and start the consumer. 

Windows:
```shell
.venv\Scripts\activate
py -m consumers.json_consumer_uma
```
as
Mac/Linux:
```zsh
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m consumers.json_consumer_uma
```


## Task 9. Start a CSV Producer

Follow a similar process to start the csv producer. 
You will need to:
1. Open a new terminal. 
2. Activate your .venv.
3. Know the command that works on your machine to execute python (e.g. py or python3).
4. Know how to use the -m (module flag to run your file as a module).
5. Know the full name of the module you want to run. Hint: Look in the producers folder.

What did we name the topic used with csv data? 
Hint: See the producer code and [.env](.env).

## Task 10. Start a CSV Consumer

Follow a similar process to start the csv consumer. 
You will need to:
1. Open a new terminal. 
2. Activate your .venv.
3. Know the command that works on your machine to execute python (e.g. py or python3).
4. Know how to use the -m (module flag to run your file as a module).
5. Know the full name of the module you want to run. Hint: Look in the consumers folder.

What did we name the topic used with csv data? 
Hint: See the consumer code and [.env](.env).

## Task11. Start a Custom CSV Producer

In VS Code, open a terminal.
Use the commands below to activate .venv, and start the producer. 

Windows:

```shell
.venv\Scripts\activate
py -m producers.csv_producer_uma
```

Mac/Linux:
```zsh
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m producers.csv_producer_uma
```

What did we name the topic used with JSON data? 
Hint: See the producer code and [.env](.env).

## Task 8. Start a  Custom CSV Consumer

Consumers process streaming data in real time.

In VS Code, open a NEW terminal in your root project folder. 
Use the commands below to activate .venv, and start the consumer. 

Windows:
```shell
.venv\Scripts\activate
py -m consumers.csv_consumer_uma
```
as
Mac/Linux:
```zsh
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m consumers.csv_consumer_uma
```


## About the Smart Smoker (CSV Example)

A food stall occurs when the internal temperature of food plateaus or 
stops rising during slow cooking, typically between 150°F and 170°F. 
This happens due to evaporative cooling as moisture escapes from the 
surface of the food. The plateau can last for hours, requiring 
adjustments like wrapping the food or raising the cooking temperature to 
overcome it. Cooking should continue until the food reaches the 
appropriate internal temperature for safe and proper doneness.

The producer simulates a smart food thermometer, sending a temperature 
reading every 15 seconds. The consumer monitors these messages and 
maintains a time window of the last 5 readings. 
If the temperature varies by less than 2 degrees, the consumer alerts 
the BBQ master that a stall has been detected. This time window helps 
capture recent trends while filtering out minor fluctuations.

## Later Work Sessions
When resuming work on this project:
1. Open the folder in VS Code. 
2. Start the Zookeeper service.
3. Start the Kafka service.
4. Activate your local project virtual environment (.env).

## Save Space
To save disk space, you can delete the .venv folder when not actively working on this project.
You can always recreate it, activate it, and reinstall the necessary packages later. 
Managing Python virtual environments is a valuable skill.
